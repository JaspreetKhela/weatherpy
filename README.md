# WeatherPy

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, users can choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps JavaScript API, a travel route can be created amongst the four chosen cities where each city has a marker that displays a recommended hotel, the city's name, the city's country, and the city's current weather.
